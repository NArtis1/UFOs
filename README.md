# UFOs

## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to build a webpage that would be user friendly, that would allow its  users to interact and filter out data on UFO sightings based on multiple criteria such as dates, city, state, country, and shape.


## Results 
This is the start of the webpage. There is an introduction on UFO sightings. When you scroll down the webpage you will see the portion with the data you can filter through.

Anytime you want specific information on a UFO sighting whether its is based on a particular date, city, state, country, or even shape of the UFO you can enter the specifics in the designated search bar and get what you are looking for. Here is an example of what that might look like.

## Summary
Overall we build a clean a webpage, one drawback I noticed is, there are many potential options for cities, states, and even shapes to pick from. To be sure that there was a sighting in a specific area you would have to keep changing the search criteria, even if you want to be there has been a specific shape about a sighting you would basically have to guess. I would recommend adding a dropdown menu allowing you to see all the cities, states, and shapes available. Another recommendation I have is a reset filter option.
